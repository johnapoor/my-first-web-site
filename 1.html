    <h2>HTML이란 무엇인가</h2>
    <p><a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/" target="_blank" title="html5 specification">The HyperText Markup Language or HTML</a> is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as <strong>Cascading Style Sheets <u>(CSS)</u></strong> and scripting languages such as JavaScript.</p><img src="coding.jpg" width="100%"><p style="margin-top:40px;">HTML can embed programs written in a scripting language such as JavaScript, which affects the behavior and content of web pages. Inclusion of CSS defines the look and layout of content. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), former maintainer of the HTML and current maintainer of the CSS standards, has encouraged the use of CSS over explicit presentational HTML since 1997.[2] A form of HTML, known as HTML5, is used to display video and audio, primarily using the <canvas> element, in collaboration with javascript.</p>
